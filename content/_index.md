## Redeeming Technology, Rooted in Reformed Thought

* **Kingdom-Focused Projects:** Showcasing creative projects that embody our core principles, blending innovative technology with a desire to honor God and serve our neighbor.

**Our Core Themes:**

* **A Reformed Philosophy of Technology:** Unpacking the underlying assumptions of our digital tools and evaluating their impact on humanity and creation from a biblical standpoint.
* **Digital Ethics and Biblical Morality:** Navigating the moral landscape of code, AI, and online interactions through the unchanging principles of God's Word and Reformed ethical frameworks.

Code & Creed is a community for those within the Reformed tradition who believe that technology, when rightly understood and stewarded, can be a tool for God's glory and the flourishing of His creation. We are driven by a desire to engage deeply with the digital world while remaining firmly rooted in the unchanging truths of Scripture and the rich heritage of Reformed theology.
